The moment you've all been waiting for: the launch of our new generative AI web app. And let's face it, who doesn't love a good AI-powered image creation and manipulation tool?\n\n### Splashhh generative art - the WebApp\n\nWe've all heard the old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words, but with our app, you can create an entire novel's worth of images in minutes. Whether you're looking to turn a simple sketch into a stunning masterpiece or upscale a grainy photo to make it pop, our AI models have got you covered.\n\nAnd the best part? You don't have to be a Photoshop wizard to use it. Our app is so easy to use that even your grandma could create a beautiful image with it (no offense to grandmas who are already Photoshop wizards).\n\n> But let's be honest, the real fun of using AI for image creation is seeing what crazy, unexpected things it comes up with. Who knows, maybe you'll discover the next Mona Lisa, or maybe you'll end up with a blobfish wearing a top hat. Either way, it's all in good fun.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Check out our app and unleash your inner artist (or blobfish enthusiast). We promise it'll be a whale of a time (or blobfish, we're not picky).\n\n[Try the WebApp](https://sd.splashhh.cc). Works even on mobile.\n\n![alter-text](/images/post/Splashhh-web-app2.webp)\n*Prompt: \"Space, child drawing\"*\n\nOur web app is designed to offer three major features: text-to-image, image-to-image, and upscale.\n\nWith the text-to-image feature, you can type in any text, and our AI model will generate a corresponding image based on your input. It's like having a personal artist at your fingertips, ready to create a masterpiece out of your words.\n\nThe image-to-image feature enables you to transform one image into another with the help of our AI-powered models. Want to turn a landscape photo into a Van Gogh-esque masterpiece? No problem. Want to cartoonify your pet's photo? We have you covered.\n\nLast but not least, our upscale feature uses cutting-edge AI techniques to upscale low-resolution images to high-resolution masterpieces, all without losing the image's quality or details.\n\nOur web app is easy to use, even if you don't have extensive experience with image editing. You can create stunning art with just a few clicks and let your imagination run wild. Who knows, maybe you'll even discover the next big thing in art.\n\n[Try the WebApp](https://sd.splashhh.cc).
